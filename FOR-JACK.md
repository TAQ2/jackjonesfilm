# Jack Jones Film — Website Rebuild

Hi Jack! We've rebuilt your website as a simple static site to replace Wix. This means no more monthly/yearly Wix fees — the new site can be hosted for free on Cloudflare Pages with the same fast loading speeds worldwide.

The new site looks and works the same as your current one. Below are a few things we need from you to finish it off.

---

## 1. Hero Slideshow

The top of the homepage now has a rotating slideshow (matching your Wix site) that cycles through 4 images. However, the original hero image exported from Wix is low resolution.

**What we need:** If you have a better quality version of the main hero image, send it over and we'll swap it in. The other 3 slideshow images (BONES thumbnail, AL(LY)IEN thumbnail, Under the Sun) look great.

## 2. Unreachable Pages on Your Current Site

While rebuilding, we found 6 project pages that exist on your Wix site but **aren't actually linked from anywhere**. Visitors can't reach them by clicking anything on your site — they only show up if someone types the exact URL. The pages are:

- Under the Sun
- May 28th
- Espinas Mezcal Ad
- Wild Spirit
- Landscape Magazine Photoshoot
- Summer Secrets

Each of these pages still has Wix's default placeholder text ("This is placeholder text. To change this content, double-click on the element...") instead of real descriptions, which suggests they were never finished.

**We downloaded all the images from these pages just in case**, so nothing is lost. But we haven't included them in the new site since they weren't being used.

**What we need you to decide:**

- **Option A: Leave them out.** The new site matches what visitors actually see today. If you want to add project pages later, we can do that anytime.
- **Option B: Include them.** If you'd like these pages on the new site, we'll need you to fill in the details for each one:
  - Project title
  - Client name
  - Year
  - A short description (1–3 sentences about the project)
  - Which section they belong to (Director? Videographer? Photographer?)
  - Where they should link from (e.g. should the Photographer gallery images link to these pages?)

## 4. Social Media Links

We've added social media icons to the About section of the site, linking to the profiles we found online. **Please review these and let us know if any should be removed or changed:**

- **Instagram:** @jack__jones (https://www.instagram.com/jack__jones/)
- **TikTok:** @jackjonesfilms (https://www.tiktok.com/@jackjonesfilms)
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-jones-b73798296/
- **IMDb:** https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5853194/
- **Vimeo:** https://vimeo.com/user183702104

If any of these are wrong, outdated, or you'd rather not link to them, just let us know and we'll remove them. If there are other profiles you'd like added, send those too.

---

## 5. Anything Else to Change?

The rest of the site has been rebuilt to match your current Wix site:

- **Hero** — Rotating slideshow of 4 images (matching your Wix homepage)
- **Director section** — BONES and AL(LY)IEN, titles link to YouTube videos
- **Videographer section** — Your Vimeo showreel
- **Photographer section** — Swipeable carousel of all 16 gallery photos (touch-friendly on mobile)
- **About section** — Your headshot, bio, email, and social media links
- **Copyright year** — Now updates automatically each year
- **SEO** — Search engine optimisation, social sharing tags, sitemap, and structured data all set up

If any of the text, links, or images need updating, now is a good time to let us know — for example:
- Is the bio still accurate?
- Are the YouTube/Vimeo links still the right ones?
- Do you want to add or remove any photos from the Photographer gallery?

---

## 6. Domain

Your current domain (jackjonesfilm.com) can be pointed to the new site once everything is ready. This won't cause any downtime — we set up the new site first, then switch the domain over.

You don't need to do anything for this step yet. We'll walk you through it when the time comes.

## Summary — What We Need From You

1. **A higher-quality hero image** (optional — the slideshow works fine as-is, but the main hero is low-res)
2. **A decision on the 6 unreachable project pages** — keep them or leave them out?
3. If keeping them, **fill in the project details** above
4. **Review the social media links** we added — remove any you don't want, add any we missed
5. **Any other updates** to text, photos, or links
